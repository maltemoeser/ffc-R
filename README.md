# Fragile Families Challenge in R

This is an example for a simple submission to the [Fragile Families Challenge](http://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/) written completely in R.

It features
- a slightly improved imputation script (removing highly correlated features, encoding categorical features)
- cross-validation to find optimal parameters for a linear model

Make sure to visit [http://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/](http://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/) to learn more about the challenge, apply for the data and create your own submission.
See [maltemoeser/ffc-challenge](https://github.com/maltemoeser/ffc-challenge) for a submission written in Python.
